0.0,"I agree; I don't want to grant them the legitimacy of protestors. They're greedy, small-minded people who somehow seem to share the mass delusion that this is not only a good idea for themselves as individuals, but is the right thing to do for ranchers at large. Basically: take something that currently belongs to everyone, and give it to a select group of people, so they can profit."
0.0,Interesting. I'll be curious to see how this works out. I often refrain from commenting because I don't have the time or desire to engage with the couple of resident trolls who seem to jump on every active WW comment thread.
0.0,Awesome! I love Civil Comments!
0.0,"I'm glad you're working on this, and I look forward to seeing how it plays out.    The comments sections of online news stories have the potential to be great tools for community interaction about current events, a Neo Town Hall, of sorts.  One of the reasons I rely on Reddit as a platform for news and local discussions is that there's a sense of community interaction that's often lacking in my ""real life,"" hectic discussions.  

But hopefully we won't be tempted to silence those who take unpopular stances."
0.5,"Angry trolls, misogynists and Racists"", oh my. It doesn't take all of my 150 IQ to see the slant here.  it's the ""Diversity diode"" at work yet again. ""We can say anything that we want because we are Diversity. You on the other hand must only  say what we allow you to say. From now on, winning arguments against any member of diversity will be considered offensive language.  facts, cogent, linear posts and Math are now verboten."
0.0,Nice to some attempts to try to make comments better—it feels like any innovation in commenting communities ended with the launch of Disqus nearly a decade ago.
0.0,"One would hope that the purpose of introducing this system is to encourage more debate and discussion, not less.  It seems there are several things that limit the flow of discussion:  Making comments that are personal attacks or encouraging witch hunts; true spam (which has been a real problem on WW's comment section, in my experience); and chasing rabbits to draw discussions away from the primary subject at hand.

I, for one, don't want to see unpopular opinions silenced.  Healthy debate is an important component of a civil society.  But when discussions degenerate into insults and distraction, it actually limits the ability of people to talk with each other.  I'm believing that this is the intention of your newspaper here, and I hope it's a movement that results in more, not less, commentary on current events.  We need it."
0.0,"Comments will be randomly chosen and be reviewed by more than one person. But I bet the Civil people have an even better, more thorough answer to this question!"

0.0,"I agree! Comments have so much potential to be places for active discussion, especially in publications that already serve an amazing community (but then, I'm biased—I'm a Civil co-founder). We've worked hard to make sure that the comments section won't become an echo chamber, though, by combining clever algorithms on the backend with the peer reviews. That's also why there are two separate questions: ""is this a *good* comment?"" and ""is this comment civil?"""
0.0,"Great question! It's one we're asked a lot. We've designed the system assuming that people *will* try to abuse it. So, in addition to the peer reviews, there are algorithms on the backend doing a lot of meta-analysis. I'm sure the system isn't 100% perfect yet, but we know from months of beta testing that it's a really solid start, and we'll keep working to improve it!"
0.0,"Thanks, Christa!  Will you be adding any features to allow overall ""upvotes"" of the article itself?  Also, notification settings for users?"
0.0,"Our aim is actually the opposite: we want spirited debate in which everyone feels free to participate, without fear of harassment, abuse, or death threats. Right now, a lot of voices are being silenced due to that fear. We designed Civil Comments for civil, respectful discussion and debate—we don't want it to become a ""positive comments only"" echo chamber. There's a lot going on on the backend to prevent abuse of the system. So, everyone is free to speak their mind, even if their opinion is unpopular—so long as they treat each other with respect."
0.0,"Thanks! We're really going to try — not only to improve civility, but also to make comments more dynamic and interesting."
0.0,I applaud Civil's efforts to create some new technology in this field. Hoping for more thoughtful discussions moving forward.
0.0,Why bother writing a review if it's going to be this devoid of content?  I understand that you work for WW. (but that hardly seems like an excuse when Fred Armisen recorded radio voices for Grand Theft Auto IV with the same number of people.)
0.9125,Yet call out all Muslims for the acts of a few will get you pilloried.   So why is it okay to smear an entire religion over these few idiots?  Or is this because it's okay to bash Christian sects?
0.0,"I love the idea of upvoting entire articles, though this would have to be something that the Publisher could turn on and off. We do have a ton of other features currently in the works—following (and blocking!) other users, bookmarking articles during the review process, to read later (I find myself wanting to read the articles that other people are commenting on, as I'm reviewing their comments!), following conversations, and so much more.

It is a walk-in group to people 18 and up. No matter the diagnosis we welcome them and help them learn new coping skills and develop tools to further  help them learn to cope from week to week. We have groups all over Multnomah County. By going  to http://nami.multnomah.org/. You will with out much difficulty find the list of Connection Groups and their times and locations.

0.0,"Ah, so part of the ""back end"" and ""algorithms"" - automatic comment rejection if you don't vote on the 3 random comments in a way that is conforming enough to the way other users vote - or if you vote too fast, as I assumed many would do - just clicking a random button too quickly means that you're unwilling to ""participate"" - you just want to ""comment"" which doesn't ensure a ""civil"" community of commenters :

I definitely get a newspaper not wanting outsiders handling that, for fear of confusion and accusations of bias.  It seems like every OregonLive comment thread has accusations of bias due to deleted posts despite repeated insistence that comment moderation is not handled in-house.

0.0,"Hi David, we did consider all of these possibilities when building our system! In fact, we assume people will try to game it; that's why we have a lot going on behind the scenes algorithmically. The commenter-facing part of the app is very straightforward, but there are a lot of checks and balances on the backend to prevent coordinated attacks and also to keep comments sections from becoming echo chambers. Banning insulting words isn't enough, unfortunately; people will always be smarter than word filters, even if the algorithm tries to take context into account. We do have a backup algorithm for low-volume situations that basically does this (plus a few other things), but it's not as effective as human reviewers.

Well, LaVoy Finicum just had his foster children taken from his ranch, likely as a result of him becoming a militant criminal likely to face a suite of federal felony charges. Some reports and tax filings from his home state suggest Finicum was receiving, some years, $100,000 from Catholic Charities to provide foster care. While - according to his statements to the media - his cows barely pay for ranch expenses, the money from the kids could presumably pay for his lifestyle (surely other state money also helped). Was he getting free labor from boys who could work with him on his ranch? Perhaps, but all we know is that with the loss of his foster kids, Finicum is sad to be losing his monetary income, and says he may have to go back to eating rice and beans now that he's not getting paid thousands a week to house, feed, and provide ample ranch work for foster kids."
0.0,"Am I missing something, because there's nothing about the ""free-range, organic, cruelty-free"" section that appeared to be joking, or have any self-deprecating self-awareness, which is what this whole deal hinges on. Are there any commenters who are going to call the supervisor on this obvious distortion? 

I think this email-leaking parent did exactly the right thing. If a teacher has been assigning something like this for 20 years, there's no point in ""confronting her directly"". If her supervisor comes up with the line that defends her free-range, earth-friendly snobbery was ""a joke"", there's no reason to talk to anyone at the school about this assignment (clearly the entire administration sees the mind-numbing cognitive dissonance in labeling a cake full of sugar ""earth friendly"" and ""cruelty free""). Leak it to the WW, and see what happens: Lo and behold, suddenly the creativity-loving food snob changes her tune.

There's nothing wrong with advocating for creativity (though I personally am skeptical of elementary school creativity proselytizers). There's absolutely nothing wrong with using and advocating ""earth friendly"" and ""human healthy"" ingredients.  But a middle school teacher - even one who lives in Portland - has no credentials to know what these ingredients are, and no right to push parents of her students to make financial lifestyle decisions based on the teacher's personal moral stance on branding and labeling of chicken and wheat products. In any case, she's recommending they make cakes out of cookie or brownie or cake batters. The number 1 or 2 ingredient is going to be some form of sugar, which is probably the worst thing you could eat, health-wise, and ""plantation-consciousness""-wise, anyway."

Note how the FBI seems to think that the media and locals of Burns are the problem not the ""occupation"".

0.0,"This comment system is so crappy you can't cut and paste a reasonable sized document, so here goes in multiple posts the actual ballot measure as voted on.  Nowhere will you find an elephant reserve listed. There is no breach of contracts

QUESTION: Shall Zoo protect animal health and safety; conserve, recycle water; issue $125 million in general obligation bonds; require independent audits?

If the bonds are approved, they will be payable from taxes on property or property ownership that are not subject to the limits of Sections 11 and 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

SUMMARY: Measure will:
Provide more humane care for animals: update four outdated and undersized enclosures with larger, more natural and safer spaces

Protect animal health and safety: modernize Zoo's substandard 45 year old animal clinic determined deficient by the American Zoo Association."
0.0,"Part 2 of the actual ballot measure.

Increase access to conservation education: provide more space for summer camps, classes and hands-on learning for kids, adults, and families.

Improve water quality: replace the Zoo's 1950's sewer system, reducing pollution by separating sewage from storm water, harvesting runoff for reuse.

Conserve, reuse water: install water recycling filtration systems; replace leaking, worn-out plumbing, irrigation systems, saving 11,000,000 gallons of water annually.

Improvements will meet sustainability standards.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Oregon Zoo is committed to the conservation of endangered species and their habitats–both locally and around the globe–while at the same time providing adults and children with one-of-a kind recreational experiences and hands-on-learning about wildlife and conservation."
0.0,"Part 3 ballot measure
It is the oldest zoo west of the Mississippi ; during its 50-year history at the current location, key parts of the Zoo have become old, out-of-date and worn out.

The Zoo bond measure will update and replace old exhibits and facilities, increase access to conservation education, and replace utility systems to reduce water and energy use and lower operating costs.

More Humane Conditions for Elephants
Outdoor space will increase from 1.5 to 6 acres, adding watering holes, shade structures, large trees, and boulders, providing more outside exercise and offering a more natural environment.

Protecting the Health of Polar Bears
Provide cooler temperatures and more humane conditions by removing concrete and adding land and pool space.

More Humane Enclosures for Apes and Monkeys
A renovated exhibit will replace the current cage-like conditions with larger indoor and outdoor areas, adding running water and more natural conditions."
0.0,"Part 4 of ballot measure.

Dedicated Space for Conservation Education
Replace two 12 year old modular trailers, a former storage space, a basement and leased off-site space with new presentation, classes and camp space for the over 100,000 children and adults attending annually.

Condors
Provide an on-site Condor exhibit.

Protect Animal Health & Safety
Replace the substandard 45-year old animal hospital and quarantine buildings with facilities meeting modern standards."
0.0,"I wasn't living in Portland in 2008, but have seen the taped statement of Metro councilmember Collette assuring an audience, prior to the vote, that an off-site preserve for the elephants would definitely be included in the zoo bond. Metro and the zoo are continuing to treat these animals as a commodity and profit generator."
0.0,"Part 5 of ballot measure

Save Water, Reduce Water Pollution, Improve Water Quality
Since most of the zoo's pipes, plumbing and irrigation systems also date back to the 1950s and '60s, many are outdated, leaking and well past their useful lives. The most expensive utility cost at the 55-acre zoo is water, and leaking pipes, run-off, inadequate filtration systems, and lack of water storage all contribute to wasting water and increasing costs. Replacing the sewer system and separating sewage from storm water will reduce pollution, improve water quality and save costs. Adding modern water filtration and recycling systems to the hippo and penguin pools will save over 11,000,000 gallons of water every year.

That's all the relevant parts of the ballot measure. No mention of an elephant reserve. That's what was voted on.

0.0,"Nick - I would be delighted if climate activists were showing up to argue for both density and housing affordability. Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive. Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop. I think it's important for people who care about the climate to explain that to their fellow citizens. As to gentrification, cause gentrification; what causes gentrification is rich people moving here. If we built zero new housing, the rich people moving in would still drive up the price of the existing housing."

0.0,"Predatory patrol towing isn't a big subject, and there is no advocacy group that is paying any attention to it, but the City of Portland has completely backed off of enforcing state law where the towing predators are operating on private property, and this is Commissioner Novick's failure. He's in charge of towing.

The City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).

Led by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.

It is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to ""compensate"" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.

Portland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.

Senator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall. I hope you are that champion."
0.0,"An elephant in a zoo is an animal exhibition in a sterile, unnatural environment. Artificial breeding is not natural. It is a tortuous procedure as tubes for insemination are forced up the female's reproductive tract. Elephants in zoos are prone to TB, hepatitis, joint and foot problems, and early deaths, not to mention boredom and depression of constricted movement.  
In contrast, larger tracts of land in sanctuary allow elephants a more natural life.  It's a holistic approach to what the elephants need.  They are more apt to flourish and show off their gentle and playful personalities.  Visitors see an elephant more similar to those in the wild.  In sanctuary, it's a win-win for elephants and patrons alike!

0.0,"There is an option that would be a better long term solution. Move the Spanish immersion program (SIP) from its location at Ainsworth to a currently unused facility like east Sylvan. This will open up room for 300 students at Ainsworth.

The overall PPS SIP is a great concept and espouses the goals of diversity, accessibility, and inclusion.

However, the SIP at Ainsworth is the dirty little secret of the Westside. It does not meet any of the above goals. There is no diversity, access is difficult, and it is run like an exclusive private school, funded by taxpayer money. Schools overcrowded? No problem, SIP is capped at 26 students per class. Lack of budget for teachers? Not an issue, SIP has assistant teachers for every class!  

How is this even compatible with the PPS equity initiative?

Moving the Ainsworth SIP will help meet its true goals, but there is strong resistance to this because it would inconvenience some privileged families that live in the mansions close to the school."

0.0,"I always find the Star Wars/Star Trek debate funny because they seem so different to me that I have a hard time understanding how the two can be compared. Star Trek was created as a series of books and an episodic TV show, meaning that it was meant to have discreet stories told and wrapped up in a short time. Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic. There are many other reasons, but fundamentally, comparing SW and ST does not seem like an appropriate comparison. (Also, if you insist on comparing them, it would probably be best to be done by someone with a reasonable degree of knowledge of both properties.)"

Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. 

Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine.

0.0,"In the interest of understanding each other, I will include my comments as they were written for this article.

Hi Rachel,

In brief, I have quite a few concerns about the Commissioner's approach, namely that pursuing density without adequate protections in place to prevent displacement and invest in community stability for existing residents (in particular low-income renters, communities of color) puts us on the wrong path to being the next San Francisco where hardly anyone of modest income can afford to live. Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a ""sustainable, equitable"" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment."
0.0,"To my knowledge, the commissioner has yet to endorse Anti-Displacement PDX's 28 measures in the Comprehensive Plan. This is a crucial first step--but still just a first step--in giving the city the tools and underlying mandates necessary to better confront the problem. There's a long way to go in removing state-level pre-emptions on rent control, inclusionary zoning, and the minimum wage--all things that impact the ability of people to afford living in the city. 

I am happy to talk more about this today over the phone, but would also be happy to field questions over email if that's easier.

All the best,

Adam"

From Rachel: ""Could you tell me what you think of that criticism from him -- that the local environmentalists aren't mobilizing on what's an important issue that would actually have an important impact locally?""

Me:
""I don't think that there is a consensus among local environmental groups about exactly how we should be increasing density. A lot of these neighbors who are dominating the comp plan hearings are complaining about the loss of mature trees, solar access, and the general character of their neighborhoods. I think a lot of environmentalists see density development driven by a market frenzy as sometimes inherently in contradiction with some environmental values. <continued>"

It's one thing if the density is resulting in more sustainable livable communities, but we are not exactly evaluating these developments and this growth on both sides of the ledger--including in particular metrics for displacement. We aren't requiring that enough social good be done. And when we try to incentivize social good instead of require it, it is comes in measures far too inadequate to do much to solve the problems we're facing. Many people in the grassroots understands that density is a radically transformational force in neighborhoods--and one that is controversial in both legitimate ways and in NIMBYist ways.

0.2,"""What causes gentrification is rich people moving here. ""

Nope. It's the uncontrolled housing market that causes gentrification. As neighborhoods become more desirable, the market allows rich people to compete amongst each other and drive prices up. They are also able to privately capture the value that is added with things like infrastructure improvements, even though those things are publicly funded. But it's possible to control this with things like Community Land Trusts. Rich people are only able to drive up prices because our uncontrolled, private market, that treats housing as just another commodity rather than a human right, allows it. 

Sustainable living for the rich, while everybody else gets pushed to the suburbs, is not Climate Justice. It's actually a grave injustice to all the people who want to live in a sustainable Portland but are basically being told they don't deserve to because they don't make enough money. Fix that and people might get on board with development."

0.0,"Yes, public transportation services Like Uber and Lift, now subject to the City's regulatory code, should be held to the same standards that every other public transportation provider is held to.  

Taxis have an unfunded mandate from the City requiring them to have wheelchair accessible vehicles in at least 10% of their fleet.  They can only charge the same rates as regular cabs.  This results in the taxi companies subsidizing them, while at the same time trying to remain competitive with a huge multi-national corporation that does not share that mandate.

While this denial of service to wheelchair-bound users is probably the most egregious of Novick's concessions to Uber (although I would argue that a close second is surely the Non-Disclosure Agreement they signed) there are many others, such as requiring smart phones and credit cards.

You are struggling with he fact that the working class folks in Portland do not want to live the New Urbanist dream.  Look at the big study Metro did to gauge housing preferences. 

Finally, I note you put a lot of trust in the people who own large apartment complexes to not exploit the inherent vulnerability that comes with being a renter.  The SFH gives people autonomy.  Yes, housing prices can drop, but so can any other investment.  Take my 401k- please..."

Nonsense.  The NY Times had been writing slobbery articles about Portland, whether for the Travel section, or about progressive urban planning/quality of life, for years before Portlandia came on the air.  

There has always been an influx, but the acceleration began in the early 2000s, which tracked with the nationwide trend of younger people as well as middle-aged urban professionals moving back into the city core in pretty much every major, desirable city in the country.  You don't think the same thing hasn't happened in NYC, LA, SF, etc.?  Portland is not unique in terms of rising rents, gentrification, the city center getting more crowded and competitive, etc.  And it's definitely not unique in the fact that its character is changing - that also happens with every other city.

Portlandia was a reflection, not a cause, of what has been happening over the past 2 decades.  Could just as easily have been Brooklyndia."

I've lived in LA for 15 years and love the sunshine and cosmopolitan mix of people. People here are used to newcomers and don't whine about wannabe actresses who migrate from Kansas and end up living in a North Hollywood flop house while working part-time in the porn industry. They don't bemoan the Mexico City transplant with a law degree who is serving vegan plates at a Silverlake diner. Influxes of enervated Californians and trailblazing Brooklyn hipsters will always find their way to Portland. Some will stay. Some will leave. In the end, Portland will become richer with character. You have a beautiful city. Enjoy it. By the way, please quit importing your damn trendy foodie namesakes to LA. It's just looks bad."

I understand that being overworked and over saturated with the politics involved in a revolution can take its toll, but I think that blaming it on Bernie supporters (as if they are any different than Hillary supporters) is unfair. It smacks of favoritism, which pretty much shoots down any ""unity"" argument.

Politics is no longer about unwavering loyalty to The Party, and absolute, unquestioning support of The One favorite within that party. It's an ""all bets are off"" revolt against the trap that is a two party system. It can be quite an adjustment to accept that no one is required to support a candidate just because of party affiliation.

None of these goals are the primary focus of city government. The main functions of a city are providing potable, affordable water, waste water removal and public safety. After that housing and street repair policy and everything else are on the same level and must compete for attention and funding. Below all of that is ""growing responsible businesses."" Actually that is so far down the list it isn't even on the list.

As much as I'd like to see a qualified candidate defeat Steve Novick, it's apparent that Stuart Emmons is not that person.

I suspect that what these intruders  really care about is a land grab and cheap grazing rights for their cattle back in their home states.

They've worked out creative solutions with government agencies and environmental groups to continue using the property while protecting streambanks and wildlife.

But who has the human right to housing in Portland?  Only the people who were born and grew up here?  The people who happen to be here now when whatever law(s) you have in mind get(s) passed?  What about the people who would like to move to Portland in the future because they see opportunity here?  

There has to be some kind of sorting mechanism, and if it's not the open market, then what metric do you use that is more fair across the board?  There will always be a limited housing supply in Portland relative to the would-be population, so you will always be excluding somebody, even with the Community Land Trust model.

But San Francisco has had rent control for years, yet this is the same policy people are advocating.  If you don't want to become the next San Francisco, why on earth would you rely on the same policies that turned San Francisco into what it is today?

What San Francisco has in spades is an anti-development zoning code and general mentality, which prevents new housing (including affordable housing) from being built.

Inclusionary zoning combined with easing zoning restrictions (e.g., parking requirements) for certain types of residential construction could go a long way towards increasing affordable housing *and* creating the density/walkability that promotes sustainable living practices, and is the best place to start at this point in Portland's transformation.

Starting with rent control and anti-displacement measures will just get you to San Francisco status sooner."

Er, no? I suspect I'm missing some context here, but the government has evolved over time and (I think) largely by design. The last amendment to the US constitution was ratified in 1992. Legislative bodies revise laws all the time.  Our nation's founders didn't foresee wiretapping and little Sally having a Bouncing Betty for show-and-tell and so forth, so the government adapts to handle things. Sometimes it adapts well, sometimes not-so-well. It wasn't created to remain immutable, though."

I am writing in regards to your recent article concerning the Northwest Academy. As a student, I would like to point out numerous factual errors in your article. First of all, I respect every students’ and parents’ right to disagree with the decision that was made. However, I would like to point that 1) the student in question, with the hit list, was seen by a professional who deals with troubled adolescents. They stated to the school that he did not pose any threat to himself or other students. The student also maintains that the list was a joke, and that the individuals on it were students from a previous school. As admittedly inappropriate as it was, it is irresponsible to imply the school ignored a threat to any student’s safety. 2) The implication that because this is a 20K tuition school it should not provide students with a second chance or hold them under more social scrutiny than any other institution is absurd."

What makes these parents fearful that this student, this foolish or troubled or stressed-out 14 year old, is an ongoing danger?  What makes them think they know more about his situation than the administration and teachers who see him every day?

In no way are like the Bundy butt-inskys.  Will you defend my twenty-something niece who rents there and walk her home after a night out?  Will you pick up feces and needles?   

Police tell me Mayor Hales has directed them not to disturb people in tents.  People who walk past the squatters see the negative impacts, from tents and litter that block passage for those in wheelchairs, to needles, to feces, to more serious crime.  (They found 5 guns in a tent near where I live.)  I know of two businesses on the North Parks Blocks that closed because of the problems. Students attending Pacific Northwest College of Art frequently are accosted and fearful.  Children attending the Emerson School must dodge needles in North Park Blocks.

My niece rents at McCormick Pier Condos.  The city facilitates the dystopia next door.  The McCormick Pier HOA confrontation with Mayor Hales plus shootings in Seattle squatter camps raise the level of urgency of changing Hales’ hands off policy.

And this is winter!  With the better weather will come again the “travelers” who have no connection to Portland other than they hear the Police tolerate heroin dealing and illegal squatting.   

The legal justification Mayor Hales cited (Jones v. L.A.) is not on point AND was vacated (no precedential weight). Yes, I’ve read the US DOJ brief that decries criminalizing homelessness.  But most of the problems are not from people who had a bad break and want to return to normalcy.  They are not the problem people.  Instead, the problems are the criminals who orchestrate bicycle thefts and drug dealing, drug adicts, and scary convicts.  Criminalizing homelessness? No we are legalizing criminality.  (continued)"

The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness.

0.0,"A brief history to provide some perspective:
McCormick Pier was the first substantial project leading to the conversion of the industrial area north of Burnside, resulting in the creation of what is now called The Pearl District. It is the root of The Pearl’s trunk.
In 1979, the Bill Naito Co. acquired the property from Union Pacific. Bill Naito was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. In 1981 he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the waterfront, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed.
The company sold the property in 2002 to a developer who successfully converted the apartments into condominiums. 
Naito Parkway is named for a responsible developer who had a great influence on Portland’s growth into a unique and desirable city.

Cannabis is an entheogen and a vitamin and food.  The OLCC has literally no jurisdiction to mandate that a simple plant can't be consumed along side alcohol.  Assuming adults don't operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated, they harm nothing by enjoying any range of substances.  

Lets all remember when religious institutions gained certificates that allowed them to use alcoholic wine for sacrament during prohibition.  Lets all remember that entheogens were/are the original sacrament.

It's not that people in Portland are more ""fallen"" than any other city in the country. That is not possible so please, curb your enthusiasm for being the top denizen of iniquity in the atheist's list of who's-who in the country. 
The bottom line is that this city has a population that is uniquely ready to receive the good news of salvation made uniquely and exclusively possible in and through Jesus Christ.

First of all, Buford v. Houtz was an easement case dealing with sheep trampling over private land on the way to graze on public land.

Second, the quote above is conditional.  If a land is not left open and unenclosed, or if a government action forbids a particular use, then the land is no longer free.  Multiple acts have been passed since 1890, most importantly the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, that regulate grazing on public lands and requires ranchers to pay a fee for those rights.

It is the responsibility of the condo property owners to maintain the path and they do, that is why the property is clean and tidy, while just the other side of the fence is one of the most trash filled and dangerous areas in the city.

When a candidate can't win on policy or leadership – and challenged by those who can – they stoop to the type of tactics Novick is engaged in. 

I have known Stuart for nearly twenty years. We have been creative partners on many projects. He has always brought boundless energy, creative intuition and leadership to every effort. I have watched him facilitate dialogue among groups that are often left out of meaningful public discussion in an effort to create solutions that address the concerns of all involved.

I watched him go through a very painful divorce, and then develop a meaningful relationship with his son in the aftermath. 

The role of the press is to help create an informed public in order that we can engage in real debate about the issues that challenge us to be a better city. This only distracts from that engagement.

Only women can harm their babies. Only women can take responsibility for their health by preventing harm to their fetuses or at least taking caution not to get knocked up while doing damaging behavior to their bodies and anything connected to their body like their fetus.

There is no logical reason why men would need to use condoms or get a vasectomy as you recommended because drinking by the male is not known to impact the baby or health of the sperm significantly, although it is known to have an impact on health of the adult overall and that might impact DNA and sperm quality..

Also the affordable health care act made birth control free including IUDs for all women regardless of poverty so the CDC is already giving it out for free. All women who are poor qualify for Medicaid that covers birth control and anyone making money will have private insurance through the exchanges or their employer that pays for it.

You ask two questions: is it a good post?  that may mean very different things to different people.  Is it well written?  Do I agree with it?  ...then you ask about Civility.  If someone adamently disagrees with your opinion as expressed, they can brand it ""uncivil"" in an attempt to have it deleted.  Are there people on this site who would do that?

0.1,"It's not exactly ""breaking news"" that chronic absenteeism is a major issue in schools.  Nor is it news that it has a devistating impact on school success.  I'd predict any study of ""drop outs"" would indicate that the ""dropping out"" was preceded by a period, often a very long period, of such absenteeism.  The education committee's directing the Department of Education to ""come up with a plan"" to reduce chronic absenteeism is, in my opinion,  many, many days too late, and likely, many, many dollars too short.  

Chronic absenteeism is not a ""problem"".  It's a manifestation of the many issues and problems those ""absent"" students face.  Personal substance abuse? Parental substance abuse? Physical, sexual or mental abuse at home? Economic issues at home?  ...in fact, all of those issues which impair stability and lead to dysfunction.  We're not talking about a ""school"" problem, we're talking about serious ""life"" and ""family"" problems which are being manifested in absenteeism."

I'd love to see leased micro-brick-and-mortar bays (a la ActivSpace's ground floor retail) in some of the new developments downtown, with rents sufficiently competitive to attract food cart folks or other culinary pop-ups.

What if someone were to write a perfectly civil comment, get it through peer review, and then use the edit function to write something really nasty or threatening? Or what if they first write something like, ""Dog food tastes awful,"" get a ton of affirmative replies, and then edit it to say, ""Dog food tastes great""? 

One option would be to put each corrected comment through the full peer-review process, but that would mean you'd need to rate three comments every time you wanted to correct a spelling error, which isn't a great experience.

This is one reason we give you the editable text field one last time when you're asked to rate your own comment (the other reason is that you might reconsider what you've written, having just been through the review process for other people's comments!)

Investigative research seems to be the exception at this period of history with sound bites and 140 character comments trumping meaningful exchanges in many platforms. It would be optimal for commenters to be able to read items deleted stored in a separate area - the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Will censorship of innovative or uncomfy info result from this mandatory civility model? 

It will be edifying to see if substantial exchanges matriculate. This format limits characters - it is unusual for comments to be extensive, but for the historian/ scholarly participant, limiting characters may not be optimal. It no longer is a forum for substantial citizen journalistic discussion, only permitting comments on mainstream journalism, the writers oft rated by # of clicks by some rags.

He got either $75,000 or $50,000 for saying ""I'm going to Disney World"" in the same situation that Payton Manning used to plug drinking beer. Comments for money is not a new thing. Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Magic Johnson ... an honor roll of sports stars did the Disney World thing, as recently as in last year's Super Bowl, when Julian Edelman and Malcolm Butler both did it. 

I'm not shocked or horrified. As you point out, we're used to him selling us already. But what interests me with this is that it's going to bite him back. These days we are all more skeptical, and while the Disney World comments were taken without a lot of criticism, the beer plug sparked a fury in social media. It's not fee anymore, in the sense that his value goes down as he sells himself so blatantly. There's a zero sum game in there somewhere."

“The FBI has not, however, publicly acknowledged the specific focus, scope, or potential targets of any such proceedings.

Just as it was a different bunch of college students who found out the VW and Audi and Porche were using fake computer programming  on their cars, even though a couple of Federal and State agencies (including vaunted California) are responsible for discovering that kind of fraud.

What you're calling a level of complacency is quite the opposite. Let the comment one person thinks is a lie stand, so that person can refute it. I want both to be civil, and both to show.

I think it is outrageous for the writer to make this claim.  Lead poisoning is tolerated because by and large it is invisible and is not routinely detected.  Until a few years ago, copper pipe used to disperse water throughout our buildings was joined with lead containing solder.  Probably most houses in the country have lead in their pipes.  When water is not used often lead from the solder can dissolve and reach appreciable concentrations.

It does bring worry to the mind, since, as Commissioner Bozievich said, at some point when the timber funds run out, Lane County is going to have to look for funding for many such projects. A strapped electorate won't vote for taxes, Lane County absolutely has to have certain funds in order to survive. 

It is obvious that Lane County needs to put a lot of effort into bringing a large company into the area, one that can actually pay taxes instead of apply for relief from them. Jobs are the answer to a lot of questions, including the massive homelessness problem. To transition from a timber receipts county to a strong county that has a lot of tax revenues and jobs from employment, that will take some real magic.

Instead of focusing on that one outlier example of a releasee killing someone, wouldn't it be productive to look at the other side of the story, i.e. on situations where the release allowed folks involved to prosper and return to productive involvement with society.

I did not comment on this particular case, I commented on our system exemplified by the subject case where a charge is levied likely without any physical evidence and in the end the reality of a crime or not a crime is determined only by who is believed.  I think objectively we or a jury can never know the truth in cases like this, the jury will most likely be voting their prejudices and personal world views.  You know a grand jury is a rubber stamp and an indictment via them carries no special validation.  Grand juries approve what 99 +% of indictments sought?  When it goes to trial, the trial jury will hear a person charge another with crimes having no physical reality in the current world.  Our practice of convicting under such circumstances is a morally dubious.

I tend to place mental crimes at somewhat lower levels, mental crimes meaning that physical damage or loss is not the primary factor involved.

Many feel otherwise and place mental crimes right up there with murder.  In the present instance, however, I am trying to focus on how we know a crime has actually been committed.  A bullet in a leg provides dramatic confirmation of an event.  A story with no physical evidence is quite a different matter.

From the report, those figures are based on the numbers of probation/parole violations as a proportion of the *total* adult populations of each group. On the other hand, if you look at the numbers of violations as a proportion of the number of people in each group *already on probation/parole*, blacks are only 1.2/1.4 times more likely than whites to have probation/parole violations, respectively. 

Of course, this is reconciled by noting that the proportions of the black population on probation and parole are, respectively, 3.4 and 5.5 times the corresponding proportions in the white population. Whether this fact is symptomatic of systemic racism is debatable, but this article seems to suggest that the disproportionality is *because* blacks are significantly more likely to violate probation/parole than whites, which misrepresents the report."

I.E a predominately African American high school team competes with a predominately Caucasian team. As it appears here, the coach's message was as it should be we are all the same. 

If the allegations Ms. Wimmer has made were true, one would think that players, parents, coaches, and school administrators would be equally outraged. The other parents included in Ms. Wimmer's complaint declined to be interviewed. To me, this is a clear indication of a unhappy parental crusade to fire a coach because she feels her son was wronged in some way (PT, JV/Varisty selection, etc). Unfortunately this is now common place in the high school coaching arena and something nearly every coach has had to deal with. It just so happens in this case the coach's last name is Adelman."

My main beef with this article is that it seems to suggest that black adults are jailed at a disproportionately high rate because black adults violate probation/parole (resulting in jail stays) at a disproportionately high rate (i.e., data that would be found in Table 13, which fails to show such a lopsided disproportionality), but instead relates the data from Table 14, which seem irrelevant without also taking into account the proportions of each population on probation/parole in the first place."

What makes Mr. McDonald’s analysis particularly problematic is that he cites the Sierra Club but takes its words out of context, distorting the very meaning of some sentences.  For example, he quotes the “Sierra Club Urban Growth Management Policy Guidelines” for the proposition: “new development should respect the character of the existing neighborhood.” Mr. McDonald conveniently leaves off the preface to the sentence, which said “Generally,” and also omitted the next two sentences: “Residential densities … must be sufficient to facilitate public transit and nonmotorized transportation and to achieve increased energy efficiency and affordability of housing.  Compact redevelopment should be promoted within one-half mile of high service transit nodes and corridors.” Of course, that leads one to the exact opposite conclusion that Mr. McDonald would have us believe that the Sierra Club supports because Willamette street and 29th is a high service node and corridor!"

Also, you cannot tell us WHY the other parent declined to be interviewed. Sure, in wealthy communities there are lots of parents trying to manipulate the coaches. But also a black family will often try to keep their name out of the news on a complaint because their child still has to attend school and be in the social milieu where other kids may ostracize them for getting the coach in trouble.

It is well documented that emotional suffering does not occur in a vacuum. Victims of sex crimes frequently suffer ongoing physical symptoms resulting from their emotional anguish. Moreover, the pain debilitation from so-called mental crimes is real. When a rape victim loses the ability to enter or sustain intimate relationships or even work productively, the person has been disabled in a way that is analogous to a physical disability in terms of the impact and hardships involved. 

Finally, the ""walk it off"" attitude inherent in minimizing sexual abuse as a second-class ""mental crime"" helps to perpetuate the notion that such crimes are somehow acceptable, if only by comparison. This notion, of course, is unacceptable."

Since Sheriff Trapp says it requires 5.2 FTE to assure 24/7 coverage (allowing for shift overlap, vacations, training, sick leave, other time away from patrol) Veneta actually has a little less than 24 hour coverage from one deputy seven days a week. That is roughly the same standard that is available in the county.

Now a memory, this benefit came about after industry funded Republicans blocked legislation forcing the elimination of old technology filament bulbs, which are really just small heaters designed to also produce light. 
Removing coal from the grid is an even better step forward."

0.0,"Jacqueline Pynes asks, ""Why should the state push people to vote who are not interested enough to make the effort to register to vote under the current system, which already takes minimal effort? 
Here's the answer: because the role of the state in a democracy, however mediocre and dysfunctional the institutions of that democracy might be, is to promote the welfare of the general public. Voting is a public good. Automatically registering citizens to vote does no harm. The state should make it as easy as possible for citizens to participate in elections. As citizens participate more, they will see the wisdom of informing themselves on the issues. This is exactly what anti-voting rights people fear.
That people actually have a problem with making it easier for citizens to vote is a measure of the backward mentalites--extreme individualism, laissez-faire racism, anti-government paranoia--that prevail here and prevent American society from moving into the 21st century."

They tended to be in favor of Hillary Clinton as the best choice and they were happy that she was also a woman breaking a barrier. And then Bernie Sanders showed up, talking about real change. Your point about ""not sure Clinton is the one"" seems right on."
0.2,"Younger women ""just aren't sure Clinton is the one""--yes, this seems to typify their sentiment. What they don't realize is that if Hillary Clinton can't get women to vote for her, including young women, then the only woman that will likely be elected President in the future will be a Republican. She'll more than likely be white, will, guaranteed, be a Christian. She'll, of necessity, have to be against abortion rights, and will no doubt be an extreme fiscal conservative. In the eyes of younger Democratic-leaning women, Bernie's pure and untainted. What they don't seem to realize is Sander's political purity is a function of his former political irrelevance. Hillary Clinton has never been politically irrelevant. She's a political pugilist. This scares certain types of women.

0.0,"Yours is just one example of many why we simply should not have a tax based on a volatile and subjective value of one's property.  You pay more simply because you invested your money (that you already paid taxes on) in your home or land - which increased in value because of factors outside of your control.  Spend $100,000 building a boat, you pay no taxes on that.  If you spend $100,000 building a home on your land, you pay thousands of dollars in taxes, year after year.  You're better off with a 500sqft home and a 2000sqft yacht drydocked on your property.  Even though that sounds absolutely awesome, how much sense does it make?

Real estate is the only thing you get taxed on after you own it. It's the only thing you pay extra taxes on if you improve it while you own it.
